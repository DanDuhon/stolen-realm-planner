# Stolen Realm Planner

Character Planner for the game Stolen Realm

## Scope & Goals

The first iteration will just be a skill calculator to allow people to easily play with builds and share them with others. Skill tooltips and displayed information will be as accurate as possible based on game data and the [community wiki](https://stolen-realm.fandom.com/wiki/Stolen_Realm_Wiki). If anything looks wrong, please open an issue so I can look into it!

Future ideas:

-   character stats
-   items & equipment
-   character save import
