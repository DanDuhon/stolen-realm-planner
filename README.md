# Stolen Realm Planner

Character Planner for the game Stolen Realm

## Scope & Goals

The first iteration will be a skill calculator that allows users to play with and share builds. Builds will be encoded in shareable URLs, nothing will be stored on servers, etc. Skill tooltips and displayed information will be as accurate as possible based on game data and the [community wiki](https://stolen-realm.fandom.com/wiki/Stolen_Realm_Wiki). If anything looks wrong, please open an issue so I can look into it!

## Future Ideas/TODO

-   include skills in damage calculations
-   flesh out character stats more
-   character save import
-   items & equipment
